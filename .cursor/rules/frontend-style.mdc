# Frontend Style & Testing

- Prefer functional components; colocate UI logic with components.
- Use Zustand for global state and React Hook Form + Zod for forms (per project conventions).
- Tailwind CSS for styling; keep class names readable and avoid deep nesting.
- Testing: React Testing Library + Vitest; write tests for components, hooks, and services.
- Keep API calls in `frontend/src/services`; no fetches in components.
- Maintain accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) and responsive layouts.
