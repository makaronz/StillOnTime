# Film Industry Domain Requirements

## Core Purpose
StillOntime is a **film production logistics tool** that helps crew members arrive on time for shoots by automating schedule extraction, route planning, and notifications.

## Film Industry Terminology (MANDATORY)
Always use correct film production terms in code, UI, and documentation:

### Production Terminology:
- **Call Sheet**: Daily shooting schedule with times, locations, crew assignments
- **Call Time**: When crew member must arrive on set  
- **Wrap Time**: When shooting ends for the day
- **Crew Positions**: Director, DP (Director of Photography), Gaffer, Script Supervisor, etc.
- **Shooting Schedule**: Multi-day production timeline
- **Location**: Physical shooting location (different from "venue" or "address")
- **Setup Time**: Time needed to prepare equipment before shooting
- **Strike Time**: Time to pack up equipment after shooting

### Code Examples:
```typescript
// ✅ CORRECT - Film industry terms
interface CallSheet {
  shootingDate: Date;
  callTimes: CallTime[];
  locations: ShootingLocation[];
  crewAssignments: CrewPosition[];
}

interface CallTime {
  crewPosition: string;
  callTime: Date;
  location: ShootingLocation;
}

// ❌ INCORRECT - Generic terms
interface Schedule {
  eventDate: Date;
  appointments: Meeting[];
  venues: Address[];
}
```

## Required Time Buffers (HARDCODED REQUIREMENTS)
These buffers MUST be implemented in route calculations:

```typescript
const FILM_INDUSTRY_BUFFERS = {
  MORNING_ROUTINE: 30,     // minutes - personal prep time
  CAR_CHANGE: 15,          // minutes - switching to/from personal vehicle  
  PARKING: 10,             // minutes - finding parking on location
  PANAVISION_ENTRY: 5,     // minutes - equipment facility entry procedures
  TRAFFIC_BUFFER: 15,      // minutes - unexpected traffic delays
  EQUIPMENT_LOADING: 20    // minutes - loading gear into vehicles
} as const;
```

## Weather Integration Requirements
Equipment recommendations based on weather conditions:

```typescript
interface WeatherEquipmentRecommendations {
  rainGear: boolean;        // Rain covers, umbrellas for equipment
  sunProtection: boolean;   // Reflectors, sun scrims, shade structures  
  heatingCooling: boolean;  // Generators, fans, heaters for crew comfort
  windProtection: boolean;  // Sandbags, wind screens for equipment
}

// Weather conditions that affect shooting
enum ShootingConditions {
  CLEAR = 'clear',
  OVERCAST = 'overcast', 
  LIGHT_RAIN = 'light_rain',
  HEAVY_RAIN = 'heavy_rain',
  HIGH_WINDS = 'high_winds',
  EXTREME_HEAT = 'extreme_heat',
  EXTREME_COLD = 'extreme_cold'
}
```

## Multi-Location Shoot Handling
Film productions often have multiple locations per day:

```typescript
interface DailyShootSchedule {
  date: Date;
  locations: ShootingLocation[];
  transitions: LocationTransition[];
  totalShootingTime: number;
  totalTravelTime: number;
}

interface LocationTransition {
  fromLocation: ShootingLocation;
  toLocation: ShootingLocation;
  departureTime: Date;
  arrivalTime: Date;  
  travelTime: number;
  equipmentMoveTime: number; // Time to move cameras, lights, etc.
}
```

## Manual Override Requirements (CRITICAL)
ALL automation MUST be manually adjustable by production crew:

```typescript
interface ManualOverrides {
  customCallTime?: Date;           // Override calculated call time
  customRoute?: RouteOverride;     // Override suggested route
  customBuffers?: TimeBuffers;     // Override default time buffers
  weatherOverride?: WeatherData;   // Override weather data if outdated
  equipmentOverride?: string[];    // Override equipment recommendations
}

// Production crew can always override system suggestions
class CallTimeCalculator {
  calculateCallTime(
    shootTime: Date, 
    location: ShootingLocation,
    overrides?: ManualOverrides
  ): CallTime {
    // System calculates suggestion
    const suggested = this.calculateSuggestedTime(shootTime, location);
    
    // Manual override takes precedence  
    return overrides?.customCallTime || suggested;
  }
}
```

## SMS Alert Requirements
Critical notifications for schedule changes and weather warnings:

```typescript
interface SMSAlert {
  recipient: CrewMember;
  message: string;
  urgency: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  scheduleChange?: ScheduleChange;
  weatherWarning?: WeatherWarning;
}

// Examples of critical alerts
enum AlertTypes {
  SCHEDULE_CHANGE = 'Location changed from Studio A to Warehouse B - new call time 7:00 AM',
  WEATHER_WARNING = 'Heavy rain expected at location. Bring rain covers for equipment.',
  TRAFFIC_ALERT = 'Major traffic on suggested route. Leave 30 minutes earlier.',
  EQUIPMENT_REMINDER = 'Cold weather shoot - generators and heating equipment recommended'
}
```

## Production Workflow Integration
The app must integrate with existing film production workflows:

### Email Processing (Call Sheets)
- Parse PDF call sheets from production companies
- Extract shooting locations, call times, crew assignments  
- Handle multiple formats from different production houses

### Calendar Integration
- Sync with Google Calendar for crew schedules
- Create events with proper film industry metadata
- Handle recurring shooting schedules

### Route Planning  
- Account for equipment loading time at origin
- Consider parking availability at shooting locations
- Factor in equipment unloading time at destination

## User Interface Requirements
The UI must be optimized for film industry users:

```typescript
// Crew member dashboard priorities
interface CrewDashboard {
  nextCallTime: CallTime;           // Most important - when to arrive
  routeToLocation: Route;           // How to get there  
  weatherAtLocation: WeatherData;   // What conditions to expect
  equipmentRecommendations: string[]; // What gear to bring
  scheduleChanges: ScheduleChange[]; // Any recent updates
}
```

## Example Production Schedule Flow:
1. **Production Manager** emails call sheet PDF to crew
2. **System** extracts locations and call times from PDF
3. **System** calculates routes with film industry buffers
4. **Crew Member** receives notification with personalized call time
5. **System** monitors weather and traffic, sends alerts if needed
6. **Production Manager** can manually override any system suggestions

This domain knowledge must be reflected in ALL code, UI components, API design, and documentation. The app serves film professionals who have specific terminology, workflows, and timing requirements that differ significantly from generic scheduling applications.
